- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @j0kai
- ðŸ‘€ I want to go into career in Game Engine Developement
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about C++ and Graphical Programming with OpenGL as I build a game engine. In the future as a part of this project, I plan to focus on learning scripting with languages such as Python, C#, or Lua; as well as diving into other graphics APIs such as Vulkan and DirectX. I would also like to learn some 3D modelling with Blender at some point.
